# Body-Mass-Index-Calculator
A simple program that takes the user's height and weight and calculates their BMI.
## Description
Here's an example of how the code would work:

The user enters their height (e.g., 1.80) and weight (e.g., 70).
The program converts the entered height and weight to the float data type.
The program calls the calculate_bmi function with the height and weight as arguments.
The program calculates the BMI using the formula weight / (height ** 2).
The program prints out the BMI value.
